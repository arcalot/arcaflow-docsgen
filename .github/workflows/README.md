# Aracflow Docsgen as a Reusable Workflow

This will automatically run arcaflow-docsgen and compare the new output to the current auto-generated content, or placeholder content on the first run, of the README.md arcaflow-docsgen section.  
If required changes are detected, an automatic commit and push of these changes will be made to the working branch's README.md file.

## Requirements

Below example required somewhere in the README.md file
```yaml
<!-- Autogenerated documentation by arcaflow-docsgen -->
 
<!-- End of autogenerated documentation -->
```
## Configuration

Arcaflow Docsgen can be called in a workflow using the `plugin_path` as an input that points to the relative path of the python plugin ".py" file.

example: 
```yaml
- name: docsgen
    uses: arcalot/arcaflow-docsgen/.github/workflows/reusable_workflow.yaml@main
    with:
      plugin_path: "arcaflow_plugin_template_python/example_plugin.py"
```
